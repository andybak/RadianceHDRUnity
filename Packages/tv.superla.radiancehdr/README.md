This package enables the ability to load Radiance HDR (RGBE) images at runtime in Unity. We support RLE and non-RLE encoded images.

## Installing
The easiest way to install is to download and open the [Installer Package](https://package-installer.glitch.me/v1/installer/OpenUPM/tv.superla.radiancehdr?registry=https%3A%2F%2Fpackage.openupm.com&scope=tv.superla)

It runs a script that installs the package via a [scoped registry](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-scoped.html).

Afterwards, Radiance HDR for Unity is listed in the *Package Manager* (under *My Registries*) and can be installed and updated from there.
